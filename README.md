# Keylogger

* A repository that teaches **how to set up an isolated malware-analysis lab in VirtualBox** (safe VM practices, snapshots, host-only networks, capturing traffic) and **how to analyze suspicious binaries responsibly** (static + dynamic analysis workflow, using tools like strings/PE viewers/sandboxing) — *without* publishing malware or instructions to create spying tools.
* A repo focused on **defensive techniques**: how to detect and mitigate keyloggers and other endpoint threats, hardening tips, indicators of compromise (IOCs) formats, and sample detection checklists.
* A repo for **ethical input-handling development**: how to capture keyboard input *with user consent* for accessibility apps, including safe code examples and privacy best practices.

# VM Malware Analysis Lab — Ethical Guide

**Purpose**

This repository provides a safe, legal, and ethical guide to setting up an isolated malware analysis lab using VirtualBox and virtual machines. It explains best practices for containment, tools and workflows for static and dynamic analysis, and defensive guidance for detecting and mitigating threats such as keyloggers.

**Important — Legal & Ethical Notice**

This project **does not** provide code or instructions to create malware or surveillance tools. Only analyze samples you are legally allowed to handle, and only in an isolated lab environment. Misuse of malware or monitoring tools can be illegal and unethical.

**Contents**

- `lab-setup/` — step-by-step instructions to configure VirtualBox, create snapshots, and isolate VMs.
- `analysis-workflow/` — safe workflows for static and dynamic analysis and handling suspicious files.
- `defensive-guides/` — detection methods, hardening tips, and incident response checklists.
- `resources/` — recommended tools, reading, and safe sample sources.

**Who is this for?**

- Security students learning malware analysis
- Defenders building detection and response capabilities
- Researchers conducting approved, ethical analysis
